This repository contains analyses results of the manuscript "A phylogenetic approach disentangles interlocus gene conversion tract length and initiation rate".

To run any of the analyses in this repository, you'll need to install python 2.7 with several packages as described [here](https://github.com/xji3/IGCexpansion).

After installing all necessary python packages, you could reproduce any of the analyses in each folder. Usually, the python script (.py files) for running the analysis starts with 'Run' inside the folder.

Please contact me by xji3 _ at _ ucla.edu if you have any questions.
